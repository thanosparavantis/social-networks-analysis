# Social Networks Analysis
A Python project that was developed as a university assignment for the subject of Social Networks. The program uses the "[Stack Overflow Temporal Network](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/sx-stackoverflow.html)" dataset and is processed using the Pandas library. We partition user interactions based on timestamps. We then create a graphical representation of the network as it progressed through time. Finally, we compute Degree Centrality, In-Degree Centrality, Out-Degree Centrality, Closeness Centrality, Betweenness Centrality, Eigenvector Centrality and Katz Centrality using the NetworkX library.
